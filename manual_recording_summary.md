## 📋 Next Steps for Complete Onboarding Capture

### Option 1: Extended Manual Recording
Run another recording session with more detailed focus:

```bash
python3 manual_recorder.py
# Choose option 2 (Interactive)
# Choose focus area 1 (Onboarding flow)
# Then manually:
# 1. Click "Get Started" or "Welcome" buttons
# 2. Navigate through any onboarding modals
# 3. Complete the onboarding tour
# 4. Test closing modals and continuing
```

### Option 2: Step-by-Step Documentation
Create a manual documentation of the onboarding flow:

1. **Open your production site** in a regular browser
2. **Walk through the onboarding** step by step
3. **Take screenshots** at each step
4. **Note the exact flow** and interactions

### Option 3: Enhanced Automated Test
Modify the automated test to better capture dynamic elements:

```bash
python3 enhanced_production_tester.py
```

## 🎯 Recommended Next Action
Since we have good automated coverage but need more detailed onboarding capture, I recommend:

1. **Run another manual recording** with focus on completing the full onboarding flow
2. **Or provide me with specific observations** about what you saw during the onboarding
3. **Then we can update the local version** to match the production experience

Would you like to run another manual recording session, or would you prefer to describe what you observed during the onboarding flow?
